## Project Summary:

The main goal of the data set is to analyse the inventory by illustrating the flow of the products in accordance with customers' orders and how long it will take to place new orders for the products. The data set displays inventory data and order data. We can also check how many of these things require reordering. Which products are in high demand and which ones offer the highest value?
