# Inventory Data Analysis

## Problem Statement:

In order to make some important decisions, the owner of a retail shop wishes to obtain some insight into the statistics of his inventory. All of the company's sold inventory is covered by data. Also, he has information on previous orders, including the date, quantity, price, and other details.

The owner wants to understand the flow of inventory based on sales as well as a clear distinction between his high value, low value, high demand, and low demand products so he can order his goods as needed.

Moreover, he is interested in the stock status, the income generated by the stock, and the inventory turnover ratio.
